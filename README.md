This project performs sentiment analysis on the viral "Pacu Jalur" meme trend that emerged on platform X (formerly Twitter) using `tweet-harvest`. The goal is to automatically gauge public opinion and capture a quantitative snapshot of the sentiment surrounding this unique Indonesian cultural phenomenon.

The core of this project is the automation of the data labeling process. Instead of manually classifying tweets, a pre-trained Indonesian sentiment analysis model from the Hugging Face hub (`mdhugol/indonesia-sentiments-classification`) was implemented to efficiently label over 500 tweets.

## Project Pipeline

The project was executed through the following steps:

1.  **Data Scraping:** Tweets containing the keyword "Pacu Jalur" were collected from X (Twitter) using the `snscrape` library.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** A preprocessing function was applied to clean the raw tweet text by removing usernames, URLs, hashtags, and other noise to prepare it for the model.
3.  **Automated Labeling:** A pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face was used to automatically classify each cleaned tweet into one of three categories: `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.
4.  **Data Analysis & Visualization:** The resulting sentiment distribution was analyzed and visualized to understand the overall public opinion regarding the trend.
